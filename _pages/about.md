I'm a first year phd student supervised by Prof. [Luu Anh Tuan](https://tuanluu.github.io/) in the College of Computing and Data Science of [Nanyang Technological University(NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/).  Prior to that, I received my Masterâ€™s degree in Artificial Intelligence system from [National University of Singapore (NUS)](https://nus.edu.sg/), mentored by [Dr. Yongqi Li](https://liyongqi67.github.io/) and [Dr. Wenjie Wang](https://wenjiewwj.github.io/), under the supervision of [Prof. Tat-Seng Chua](https://www.chuatatseng.com/). 

My research focuses mainly on NLP (LLM  reasoning) and Multimodal.
